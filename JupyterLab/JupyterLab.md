# JupyterLab

The files present in this directory were created with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (instead of Jupyter Notebook). JupyterLab can be installed with pip:

    pip3 install jupyterlab

For other installation methods, please refer to the [official documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).

Start JupyterLab using:

    jupyter lab

JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.

Files created with the classic Jupyter Notebook should be compatible with JupyterLab, but I have not tested this.
